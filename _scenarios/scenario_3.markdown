Maybe you want to use a low cost or free cloud service, you can see they offer SAML on their sales literature, but
you’re having trouble getting it to work, the amount of support you’re getting from the cloud service is limited
and you’ve run out of ideas.
 
We can help, with lots of experience integrating with a range of SAML service providers we can quickly identify
problems and either rectify them, or liaise with 3rd parties to resolve the issue at their end.

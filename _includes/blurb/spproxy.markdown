# SP Install with Apache proxy

If you have a web application that needs protecting and you're not using Apache
as your web host, we can combine Shibboleth SP with an Apache proxy to your web
application. We can then relate authentication information via headers or via
the remote_user field (where supported).

This is available as a VM, or can be a docker container you can use with your
existing docker eco system.

## Features

* Metadata review and basic authentication test
* Help registering entity with UK Federation or ...
* ... Support registering with up to 5 direct metadata trusts

## Benefits

* Quick turn around
* High standard of federated access management using industry best practice
* No ongoing obligation
* Work can be completely isolated from existing infrastructure, reducing risk.

## Options

The authentication proxy is available either as a VM configuration, or as a
docker container.

### VM/Hardware hosted

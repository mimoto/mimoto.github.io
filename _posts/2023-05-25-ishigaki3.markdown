## Ishgaki 3.0.0

A major new version of [Ishigaki](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/ishigaki) is now available on [Github](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/ishigaki/pkgs/container/ishigaki) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/digitalidentity/ishigaki). Ishigaki is probably the best Shibboleth IdP base container for use with Docker, Kubernetes and other container services, and is available for both AMD64 and ARM64 platforms.

Changes include:

* The latest stable Shibboleth IdP release 4.3.1, Jetty 10, Debian 11 and Corretto Java 17.

* Jetty logging has been improved and Jetty no longer forks on startup, saving a tiny amount of time and a significant amount of RAM.

* The associated tests have been tweaked and now use Cinc Auditor.

You can read more about Ishigaki on its [Github Readme](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/ishigaki/).

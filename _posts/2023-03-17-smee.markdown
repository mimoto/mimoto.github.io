Pete Birkinshaw, one of the Mimoto co-founders, has recently
released [Smee](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/smee), an Open Source software library written in Elixir that
aims to help users download and process SAML metadata.

[SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) is a widely used standard for single-sign-on
even across different organisations. It's been around for ages now and is very widely used in education and research
organisations.

For login services (IdPs) and authenticated websites (SPs) to work together they need to both trust each and know the
technical details of how to connect and share information. This is done by exchanging metadata: XML records that act as
profiles for each service.

Exchanging and installing individual server details for services might work for small organisations using Microsoft
Active Directory, but it simply doesn't scale in higher education and research contexts where tens of thousands of
services are available so trusted metadata is curated and distributed by national research and education organisations.

Smee lets you download and process that metadata, use the information within it or create new collections of service
information.

Mimoto is now providing support and custom development of Smee.

Smee is available at [Github](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/smee), and [Hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/smee)
. Documentation is online at <https://hexdocs.pm/smee>

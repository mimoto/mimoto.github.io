You’re doing pretty well on Shibboleth and SAML. You’ve got a person looking after that role, they seem to be getting on with the work OK. Certainly you don’t seem to have the sorts of problems others tell you about. But you
wonder about cover if that person is ill or leaves. We can help by acting as a backup point of contact.

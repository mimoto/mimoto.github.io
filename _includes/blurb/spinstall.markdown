![](/assets/insight/img/card-image-small-3.jpg)

This service is perfect if you have a protected or licensed resource you want
allow one or more Universities access to.

Or if you have a website you need to restrict access to, but want to allow
access to students/academics from one or more Universities.

The basic Shibboleth SP install package is designed to get your site working
with Universities across the world quickly and easily.

Our experts will add Shibboleth SP to your existing infrastructure and help you
integrate it with your customers. Because the Shibboleth SP software is
seperate from your own site, you have a lot of freedom to host your own content
the way you desire.

Also we'll guide you through the process of getting setup with the UK Access
federation; linking you into a global trust network of many hundreds of
academic institutions which your service can then be integrated with easily.

You’re a UK college, you have a IT team of around 5 people, who are responsible for the entire IT estate. You know you’d like to take advantage of a series of Cloud services protected by your institutional single sign on
system, as well as giving your students easy off campus access to e-resources; but your team is swamped and have
no capacity to trouble shoot the setup of these new services.
        
We can help by remotely managing your IdP and working with your cloud service suppliers to bring new services
inline in a timely fashion. We can also handle security patching work so the core of your authentication
infrastructure is secure.

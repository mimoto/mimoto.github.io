We're pleased to announce that Mimoto has joined two more associations.

Mimoto is now a member of ALT, The Association For Learning Technology, the professional body for people and
organisations working with technology in UK education. We've admired the work of ALT for a while and want to support
them more directly.

Mimoto has also joined The NorthWest CyberSecurity Cluster (NWCSC) as a Micro Business Member. NWCSC is a regional forum
for meeting and discussing cybersecurity topics.

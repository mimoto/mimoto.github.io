Doormouse is a product which allows guests to access your wired IT network using their own devices such as laptops and
games consoles. This helps meet the regulatory requirement for network owners to monitor and record access.

Guests are taken through a simple self-service registration process:

*  Authentication
*  Agreement of terms
*  Device registration

As the network owner you retain control, with an administration panel allowing appropriate staff to track network access
 by guests.

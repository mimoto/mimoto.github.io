## Legacy infrastructure

All but the newest (or most diligent) of organisations have some legacy
infrastructure. But most universities have a history that pre-dates the change
in funding that has effected the sector, which is not necessarily true in other
industries. Additionally, the Higher Education sector played a central role in
the early days of the Internet. This means sometimes HE Organisations are
burdened with a legacy infrastructure based on a radically different set of
requirements and cost model than what they have today. A harder to resolve
situation than in commerce where legacy infrastructure tends to refer merely
to an out of date way of solving a problem that still exists in much the same
way it did before.

For any organisation legacy is a pain. There is much risk switching between
systems, likely user disruption, and little perceived business benefit.

These systems often quietly get on with their day to day business, knowingly or
unknowingly ignored by the IT organisation, often requiring expertise or
knowledge that has left the organisation or is the domain of very few
individuals. The strategy of waiting for the inevitable is not a good one!

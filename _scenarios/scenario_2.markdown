You're a digital design agency; you’ve got a service you want to sell to higher education organisations but they keep
asking for this ‘shibboleth’ thing. Your guys have had a bit of a look and are struggling to get your device
integrated, meanwhile you feel your losing the opportunity to make the sale.

We can help by working with your tech guys to add Shibboleth auth to your app and advising you on how to make the
integration process as easy as possible for your customers.

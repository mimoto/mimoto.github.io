## Bring your own device

A comparatively recent concern in the commercial world is BYOD (Bring your own
device). The rise of smart phone and wireless technology has posed a data
access question to organisations who hither-to did not need to consider it:
what access to organisational resources should a user owned device get?

Previously it wasn't much of a concern because few people had phones capable of
email and web, and the data access to do so was expensive at any rate. Working
from home on ones own computer was also less of an acceptable idea (to both
parties) as it is now. Organisations could easily hide all their infrastructure
behind one big firewall and control access tightly by only allowing
organisational equipment access to the corporate network.

Universities got early exposure to the bring your own device problem: students
in halls would often bring their own equipment and do their best to manage
access control in a situation where not all devices on the network could be
considered safe.

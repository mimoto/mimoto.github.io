# Indiid

Indiid is a Mimoto product that provides users with a verified digital identity. This can be used as a guest login to access different types of online resources such as journals and collaboration software.

## How does Indiid work?

Certain online resources require users to have an account with a specific provider of digital identity
 (known as federated identity providers). When a user signs up for an account with Indiid they must validate the
  email address they provide, agree terms and conditions, and select a method of verifying their digital identity.
   Each time they log on subsequently their identity can be verified using gold standard 2-step, 2-factor 
   authentication. 

## What are the benefits of Indiid?

* Allows users to access resources and services with a verified digital identity, eliminating the need to set up internal accounts
* Limits risk of external users gaining inappropriate access to data and resources
* Acts as a ‘firewall’, limiting risk and liability for data access
* Can create bespoke ‘groups’ to access specific resources

## What type of organisation is Indiid suitable for?

Indiid is suitable for a wide range of organisations wishing to allow guests access to their resources, including:

* Schools sharing information for home learning
* Small businesses and charities collaborating with researchers or individuals working remotely or overseas
* Universities and colleges sharing course materials with smaller educational institutions and language schools
* External staff (student unions, shared accommodation or catering services)
* Suppliers and contractors, business partners and consultants
* Test accounts for external collaboration software development
* University alumni

## What are the technical requirements for Indiid?
